National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey (NATSIHS)	| Health statistics data including long-term health conditions and health risk factors for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Best for cross-classification with other NATSIHS data items. Recommended data source for national and state/territory level long-term health condition prevalence rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.   
**National Study of Mental Health and Wellbeing (NSMHW)** |	Best for understanding the mental health of Australians, including their use of services and their social and economic circumstances. Recommended data source for prevalence of mental disorders.

## Methodology  

### Interviewing  

The NSMHW uses a structured interview in which trained ABS interviewers ask respondents about their experiences of symptoms of mental ill health throughout their lifetime. Responses are assessed to determine whether a person’s symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for having a mental disorder in their lifetime and in the 12 months prior to the study interview. Assessment of mental disorders is based on definitions and criteria of the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). It is a nationally representative sample survey rather than being asked of the total Australian population.    

### Data Collection  

The 2020-21 cohort is the first of two for the study. Data for the NSMHW was collected in the Survey of Health and Wellbeing (SHWB) which was conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).   

 * The first cohort was conducted between December 2020 and July 2021.   
 * The second cohort started in December 2021 and will finish in late 2022.    

Stand-alone household survey. Computer-assisted personal interview. Within each randomly selected household - one person aged 16-85 years.   


### Sample Size  

**NSMHW Cohort 1:** The study was collected over an 8-month period from 5th December 2020 to 31st July 2021    

There were 5,554 fully responding households in the study, a response rate of 57.1%.  

*Subject to sampling error as it is a sample survey (eg. the whole population is not surveyed).* 

### Data Quality and Error  

Only estimates with RSEs less than 25% are considered reliable for most purposes. Estimates with larger RSEs, between 25% and less than 50%, have been included in the publication, but are flagged to indicate they are subject to high SEs. These should be used with caution. Estimates with RSEs of 50% or more have also been flagged and are considered unreliable for most purposes. RSEs for these estimates are not published.
